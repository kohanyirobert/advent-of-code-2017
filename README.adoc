Run solutions with https://haskellstack.org[stack] like

```
cd 01
stack exec -- runghc Part1 < input.txt
```

or

```
cd 01
stack exec -- ghc Part1
./Part1 < input.txt
```

== Notes

* Day 5 -- `Part2` finishes in ~30 seconds when compiled.
* Day 13 -- `Part2` finishes in ~13 _minutes_ when compiled.
* Day 14 -- feed `-i.:../10` to `ghci` or `ghc` in order to run or compile.
* Day 20 -- `Part2` runs much faster when compiled; the solution is based on heuristic rather than a proof.
* Day 21 -- `Part2` runs very slow, it could be optimized, because all 3x3 patterns can be treated independently from each other -- divide and conquer.
* Day 23 -- feed `-i.:../18` to `ghci` or `ghc` in order to run or compile.
